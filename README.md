# sample-auth-server


Update hosts file to my auth-server, resource-server to 127.0.0.1/localhost


The manifest.yml in this app, and the associated sample-resource-server and sample-ui-client apps is set 
up to push the apps to PWS.

You will need to modify the application name in the manifests to avoid a route conflict in PWS.
